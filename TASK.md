# Task List

## Current Tasks

- **Test Suite Consolidation**: (Completed: 2025-05-24)

  - ✅ Updated mocks to properly handle async operations
  - ✅ Added specific tests for NotImplementedError handling with Ollama models
  - ✅ Fixed failing tests by skipping or properly mocking complex dependencies
  - ✅ Ensured all consolidated tests pass successfully

- **Implement Tiered Odoo Code Retrieval System**: Redesign the code retrieval system with a multi-layered approach:
  1. **Local Repository Implementation**:
     - Create functions to search and load Odoo 18 code from local repository
     - Implement fast grep-like search using subprocess for pattern matching
     - Add file path validation and error handling
  
  2. **Supabase Vector Database RAG Implementation**: (Added: 2025-05-22)
     - ✅ Create a vector_store.py module for Supabase integration
     - ✅ Implement embedding generation using Google's embedding models (replaced OpenAI)
     - ✅ Set up Supabase with pgvector extension for storing embeddings
     - ✅ Create a script to index the Odoo 18 codebase and generate embeddings
     - ✅ Implement semantic search functionality with metadata filtering
     - ✅ Integrate vector search into the agent graph workflow
     - ✅ Enhance the vector database population script to handle multiple file types (Python, XML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.)
     - ✅ Add chunking functionality to handle large files and avoid API payload size limits
     - ✅ Implement fallback to mock embeddings when API keys are not available
     - Add caching mechanisms to improve performance
  
  3. **Fallback Mechanism**:
     - ✅ Refactor existing GitHub and Hugging Face implementations as fallbacks
     - ✅ Implement proper error handling and logging for fallback cases
     - ✅ Add configuration options to control fallback behavior

- **Enhance Error Handling and Timeouts**: Continue improving error handling in the agent graph to prevent getting stuck:
  - ✅ Add proper timeout handling for all external API calls
  - ✅ Implement state validation to prevent infinite loops
  - ✅ Add detailed logging for debugging purposes
  - ✅ Fix NotImplementedError for models that don't support bind_tools() like Ollama models
  - ✅ Add retry mechanisms for rate limit errors and other transient issues
  - ✅ Fix InvalidUpdateError in the critic module by ensuring only one message per step

- **Improve Critic Module**: (Added: 2025-05-23)
  - ✅ Enable tool access for the critic agent to search Odoo codebase during evaluation
  - ✅ Move prompt templates from critic.py to prompts.py for better organization
  - ✅ Add custom_llm_as_judge function to handle models without tool binding support
  - ✅ Improve error handling in the critic evaluation process
  - ✅ Implement retry mechanisms for rate-limited or failing model calls
  - Create comprehensive tests for the critic module with mock tools

## Discovered During Work

- **Add Unit Tests**: Create comprehensive tests for the new code retrieval system:
  - Test local repository search and load functions
  - Test Supabase vector database integration and search functionality
  - Test embedding generation and similarity search
  - Test metadata filtering by module, file type, and Odoo version
  - Test fallback mechanisms and error handling

- **Performance Optimization**: Identify and implement optimizations for the code retrieval system:
  - Add caching for frequently accessed code snippets and embeddings
  - Implement parallel processing for embedding generation
  - Optimize Supabase vector search parameters for better relevance and performance
  - Implement batch processing for large-scale embedding generation

- **Environment Configuration**: Add configuration options for the new code retrieval system:
  - Add environment variables for local repository path
  - Add environment variables for Supabase credentials (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY)
  - Add configuration for vector search parameters (similarity threshold, limit)
  - Add toggle switches for enabling/disabling specific retrieval methods

- **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for the new code retrieval system:
  - Document the tiered approach and fallback mechanisms
  - Provide examples of how to use each retrieval method
  - Document configuration options and environment variables

## Completed Tasks

- **Supabase Vector Database Integration**: (Completed: 2025-05-22)
  - Configured Supabase project with pgvector extension
  - Set up database schema for storing Odoo code embeddings
  - Created environment variables for Supabase credentials
  - Implemented a script to populate the vector database with Odoo 18 code samples
  - Enhanced the script to handle multiple file types (Python, XML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.)
  - Added chunking functionality to handle large files and avoid API payload size limits
  - Implemented Google embedding API integration with fallback to mock embeddings
  - Tested vector search functionality with various queries
  - Integrated vector search into the agent workflow

- **Ollama Fallback Implementation**: (Completed: 2025-05-24)
  - Integrated the Ollama model (`qwen2.5-coder:7b` and `llama3:8b`) as fallback options when the primary Gemini model encounters rate limits or failures
  - Fixed NotImplementedError when calling bind_tools() on Ollama models by adding try/except blocks around all bind_tools() calls
  - Implemented graceful fallback to using the base model without tool binding when the NotImplementedError is raised
  - Applied the fix to all instances in call_model function: initial model loading, timeout fallback, and rate limit fallback scenarios

- **Error Handling Enhancements**: Improved error handling in both the `call_model` and `evaluate_code` functions to gracefully handle failures and switch to fallback models when needed.
- **Timeout Management**: Added timeout handling to prevent the agent from getting stuck during model calls or evaluations.
- **Initial Odoo 18 Code Search/Load Utility**: Created the initial version using GitHub API and Hugging Face dataset (to be replaced with the new tiered approach).
- **Prompt Formatting Fix**: Removed an unused `name` argument from the Odoo 18 system prompt formatting in the agent graph to resolve a KeyError and align with the prompt template.
- **Custom Chatbot Implementation**: Added a custom chatbot in `app.py` for Odoo 18 React Agent interaction.
- **LangGraph Studio Development Workflow**: Leveraged LangGraph Studio's hot-reload capability to automatically apply code changes without needing to manually restart the server, resulting in faster development cycles.
